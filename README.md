# Shopping-Cart---Web Application
The Online Shopping System is a web-based application developed as a database project. The system simulates an online shopping environment where users can browse, search, and purchase products. It was designed to integrate a front-end website with a back-end database, providing a seamless interface for users to interact with the system.

## Technologies and Tools

- **Front-End:**
  - **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Used to create a responsive and interactive user interface for the website.
  - **Bootstrap:** For styling and ensuring the website is mobile-friendly.
  - **jQuery:** To enhance interactivity and handle asynchronous requests (AJAX) for dynamic content loading.

- **Back-End:**
  - **PHP:** Server-side scripting language used to handle the logic of the application, manage user sessions, process requests, and communicate with the database.
  - **MySQL:** Relational database management system used to store and manage data related to customers, products, orders, and transactions.
  - **Apache:** Web server used to host the application and manage client-server communication.

- **Database:**
  - **MySQL Database:** The heart of the project, where all the data related to the shopping system is stored. The database includes multiple tables for customers, products, categories, orders, deliveries, payments, and transaction reports. Relationships between these entities are managed through foreign keys to ensure data integrity.

## Key Features

- **Product Management:**
  - **Categories and Products:** The system manages product categories and individual product details. Users can browse products by category, and admins can add or update product information through the back-end interface.

- **User Account Management:**
  - **Customer Accounts:** Customers can create and manage their accounts, allowing them to save their information for future purchases and track their orders.

- **Shopping Cart and Order Management:**
  - **Cart Functionality:** Users can add products to their shopping cart, review their selection, and place orders. The system ensures that cart contents are linked to user sessions.
  - **Order Processing:** Once an order is placed, it is recorded in the database, and the system tracks its status until delivery.

- **Payment Integration:**
  - **Payment Processing:** The system supports payment data handling, securely storing transaction information in the database and linking it with the corresponding orders.

- **Admin Panel:**
  - **Admin Functions:** Admin users have access to a panel where they can manage products, categories, orders, and customer information. They can also view transaction reports and respond to customer reviews.


## How to Run

1. **Setup Environment:**
   - Install a local server environment like XAMPP or WAMP that includes Apache, PHP, and MySQL.

2. **Database Configuration:**
   - Import the provided SQL file into your MySQL database to create the necessary tables and populate them with initial data.

3. **Deploy the Website:**
   - Place the project files in the `htdocs` folder (for XAMPP) or the corresponding folder in your server environment.
   - Configure the database connection settings in the PHP files (usually in a configuration file).

4. **Run the Application:**
   - Start your local server and open a web browser.
   - Navigate to `http://localhost/your-project-folder` to access the online shopping system.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the integration of a web-based front-end with a relational database back-end, providing a functional online shopping system. The combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL highlights a full-stack approach to web development with a focus on efficient data management and user experience.
